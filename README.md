DATA MINING ON AMAZON FOOD REVIEWS USING TOPIC MODELLING

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In the realm of online reviews, the sheer volume of data and information can be overwhelming. The challenge is to develop an intelligent system that addresses this issue by efficiently extracting key insights, or topics, from these reviews. The goal is to provide a streamlined and insightful analysis of the extensive information contained in online reviews, enabling a more accessible and meaningful understanding of user sentiments and preferences.

APPROACH USED:
To solve this task, we will use the concept of Topic Modeling (LDA) on Amazon Food Review data.

DATA DESCRIPTION:
PRODUCT ID,USERID,USERNAME, SCORE, SUMMARY OF COMMENT, COMMENT

LIBRARIES USED:
Pandas:

Purpose: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
Usage in Your Project: Used for reading and manipulating the dataset, particularly in handling the structured data of food reviews.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
Purpose: NLTK is a library for natural language processing (NLP) and text processing.
Usage in Your Project: Used for various NLP tasks such as text cleaning, tokenization, and stopwords removal in the preprocessing step.

Gensim:
Purpose: Gensim is a topic modeling and document similarity library.
Usage in Your Project: Employed for building and training Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models, a popular technique for topic modeling.

Spacy:
Purpose: Spacy is an advanced natural language processing library.
Usage in Your Project: Used for advanced text processing tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, entity recognition, and lemmatization.

Streamlit:
Purpose: Streamlit is a library for creating web applications with minimal effort.
Usage in Your Project: Utilized for building a user-friendly web interface for users to interact with the topic modeling results.

Matplotlib and Seaborn:
Purpose: Both Matplotlib and Seaborn are data visualization libraries.
Usage in Your Project: Employed for creating visualizations that help in understanding the distribution of topics, comments, or any other relevant information.

Gensim:
Purpose: Gensim is a library for topic modeling, document indexing, and similarity retrieval.
Usage in Your Project: Used for training the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to extract topics from the food reviews.
